1.1 Data Ingestion

Input: CSV file containing historical cryptocurrency data

Fields: date, symbol, open, high, low, close, volume, market_cap

1.2 Data Preprocessing

Steps:

Convert date column to datetime format

Sort data by symbol and date

Handle missing values using row removal

Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler

1.3 Feature Engineering

The following features are created:

Daily Returns

Rolling Volatility (Target Variable)
7-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns

Moving Averages
7-day and 14-day simple moving averages

Liquidity Ratio
Volume divided by market capitalization

Bollinger Bands
Upper and lower price bands indicating volatility

Average True Range (ATR)
Measures price range volatility

1.4 Model Design
