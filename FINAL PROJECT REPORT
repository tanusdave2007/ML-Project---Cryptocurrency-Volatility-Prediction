Introduction

Cryptocurrency markets are known for extreme price fluctuations. Predicting volatility helps traders and institutions manage financial risks and make informed investment decisions.
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency volatility using historical market data.



Dataset Description

The dataset consists of daily historical data for more than 50 cryptocurrencies, including OHLC prices, trading volume, and market capitalization.



Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis to understand trends
Feature engineering to capture volatility behavior
Training a Random Forest regression model
Evaluating model performance
Optimizing model parameters



Results:
The Random Forest model successfully learned volatility patterns from historical data.

Evaluation metrics:
RMSE: Low error indicating good prediction accuracy
MAE: Stable average prediction error
R² Score: Strong explanatory power



Insights:

Technical indicators significantly improve predictions
Rolling volatility is highly influenced by price movement
Liquidity plays a key role in volatility changes



Limitations:

Model does not account for real-time news or sentiment
Cryptocurrency markets are influenced by external factors
Past performance may not guarantee future accuracy



Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning for predicting cryptocurrency volatility. 
The model provides valuable insights into market risk behavior and can be extended for real-time applications.
